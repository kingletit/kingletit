- 👋 Hi, I’m @kingletit
- 👀 I’m interested in science and nature. I first started programming in 1969, using Algol 68 and Fortran. I ended up as the Group Business Systems Manager for BAE SYSTEMS, one of UK's biggest manufacturing companies. I then became a clinical hypnotherapist specialising in helping victims of abuse (physical, sexual and emotional). This was quite a change, although the analytic approach still helped. I am now retired.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ASP.Net & MS SQL.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything other than staying alive.
- 📫 How to reach me ... you won't need to.
